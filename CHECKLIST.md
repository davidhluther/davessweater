# Dave's Sweater — Checklist

This file is the durable single source of truth for outstanding work. Read it at the
start of each session and keep it current — check items off, add new ones, and update it
in the same change that completes a task. Do not rely on chat memory; this file wins.

## Decisions made
- **Migrating presentation to Next.js** (owner's standard stack) and growing DS from a low-effort
  joke into a substantive, Ray's-Weather-class local weather site; the **Right/Wrong Ray accuracy
  tracker is the signature differentiator**. Python data pipeline + scoring stay as the data source.
  See `planning/specs/2026-06-21-m1-nextjs-port-design.md`.
- Start with ONE full weather station in Boone; expand later.
- Hardware: Ecowitt Wittboy (WS90) all-in-one array + GW2000 gateway (~$200). Chosen over
  Ambient Weather WS-2902 (pricier, more locked-in). WS90 uses a haptic rain sensor (no
  moving parts to freeze/clog).
- Pipeline v1: station → ecowitt.net → Ecowitt API → GitHub Actions pull → commit to repo.
  Cloud-only path; fits the existing stack.
- Orange Pi NOT in the v1 pipeline. Local-push (GW2000 → Pi collector) only buys
  cloud-outage resilience / sub-minute polling / full data ownership — none of which a
  one-station daily/hourly accuracy tracker needs, and it adds a real maintenance tax. Add
  the Pi later only if local resilience or sub-minute multi-station data is genuinely needed;
  it can be added without changing anything upstream.

## Done: Next.js migration (M1)
Migrated presentation to Next.js 16 (App Router); Python data pipeline + scoring unchanged.
Spec/plan: `planning/specs/2026-06-21-m1-nextjs-port-design.md`, `planning/plans/2026-06-21-m1-nextjs-port.md`.
- [x] **M1 — Next.js port** — parity + real subfolder routes, native blog (sanitized), embedded
      Fourthwall shop modal, sitemap/robots, GA + both GSC tags, Ray's-style white logo.
- [x] **Cutover** — Vercel builds with `next build` (`vercel.json` framework=nextjs, outputDirectory=.next);
      daily Actions commit `data/` only; `build_site.py`, `docs/`, `rebuild_on_screenshot.yml` retired.

## Done: M2 — modern redesign + accuracy homepage
Original, dynamic design (own brand; shares only the teal/orange palette + the genre — **NOT a Ray's
clone**, for legal safety). Homepage leads with the joke *backed by data* — free Open-Meteo/Apple beat
paid Ray's — from `scores.json`. Mobile-first; daily iPhone screenshot co-anchors the hero (labeled
honestly real-Apple-vs-Open-Meteo-fallback); design system applied across all pages. Spec/plan:
`planning/specs/2026-06-21-m2-redesign-accuracy-homepage-design.md`,
`planning/plans/2026-06-21-m2-redesign-accuracy-homepage.md`.
- [x] **M2 — design system + accuracy homepage** — Style-A data-journalism on the dark-teal/orange
      palette; dark hero + dark feature-bands on a light body; mobile-first (header menu, tables→cards);
      brand mark "Boone's #1 weather ~~service~~ tracker"; Space Grotesk display + Inter. Lib fully
      unit-tested; `npm test`/lint/`build` green; verified mobile + desktop. **Final review corrected the
      false "dead last 29×" claim** — `totals.wrong` is the count of days *graded "Wrong" (< 60)*, not a
      per-day ranking; copy now reads "the free services were never once graded Wrong; Ray's earned that
      grade N times" and the W/L/M legend uses grade bands. **Merged to `main` + Vercel confirmed; live.**

## Done: Source Expansion (sibling pipeline milestone)
Grew the roster from 3 forecasters toward a broad set of free, automatable services behind a
source-registry/adapter pattern, and reworked scoring into the coupled, snow-aware, transparent model
(`scripts/scoring.py`, pytest-tested). Pipeline/scoring only — backward-compatible (`score`/`grade`/
`totals` + `precip_in` preserved). Spec/plan: `planning/specs/2026-06-22-source-expansion-design.md`,
`planning/plans/2026-06-22-source-expansion.md`.
- [x] **Source Expansion** — N-source adapters + coupled snow-aware scoring + per-source coverage index.
      **M3 visualizes this data.** ⚠️ Confirm the expanded roster + split rain/snow coverage actually
      reached `data/` on whatever branch M3 builds on before wiring N-source viz (the `feat/openmeteo-backfill`
      branch still carried only the 3 original sources + a single `precip_amount` field).

## Done: Open-Meteo backfill (PR #62 — merged)
- [x] **Open-Meteo historical backfill** — `scripts/backfill_openmeteo.py`; Open-Meteo has a **474-day record**;
      homepage derives a tracking-period head-to-head + a 474-day explainer; `trendSeries` scoped to the
      rays-present window. Merged to `main` + live.

## Done: Fair Ray scoring — capture fix + interval wind scoring (PR #67 — merged)
Fixed 3 capture/scoring bugs unfairly mis-scoring Ray + a latent append-only `entries[]` drift. Wind is now
scored as an **interval** with a 0.5× width vagueness tax (point forecasts unchanged → Open-Meteo provably
untouched); qualitative wind mapped via the NWS scale; precip amount honestly forfeited. Whole Ray era
backfilled from saved `raw_text` (originals preserved) + re-scored; guarded by `tests/test_scores_consistency.py`.
Plan: `planning/plans/2026-06-24-rays-capture-interval-scoring.md`.
- [x] **Ray fair scoring** — Ray ≈ 65.2 (≈flat — capture-deflation + vagueness-reward cancelled; now every
      point earned), Open-Meteo 91.65 unchanged, free wins by ~26.5, Ray's "Right" days 35→25. **Merged + live.**
- [ ] **Methodology transparency (before promotion)** — document the interval scoring + NWS qualitative-wind
      mapping + width penalty on `/right-wrong-ray` (+ refresh the stale `CLAUDE.md` scoring table).
- [ ] **Capture-quality monitoring** — alert when a source's coverage drops (this regression went unnoticed
      for weeks). Part of the promotion audit.

## Done: M3 iteration #2 — "Why we exist" scrollytelling section
Restrained, scroll-driven narrative section on the homepage (below the hero, replacing the standalone
"It's not a fluke" trend block; the existing `TrendChartInteractive` now lives at its climax node). Built
on a framer-motion timeline (scroll-driven beam via `useScroll`), five data-bound beats, spring
`NumberTicker`s, a `PointerHighlight` accent, and a `ChartReveal` clip-path draw-in. All stats derived via
`whyStats()` (vitest-tested); `prefers-reduced-motion`/mobile/no-CLS handled. Spec/plan:
`planning/specs/2026-06-25-m3-scrollytelling-design.md`, `planning/plans/2026-06-25-m3-scrollytelling.md`.
- [x] **M3 #2 — scrollytelling "Why we exist"** — framer-motion added; `NumberTicker`/`PointerHighlight`/
      `ChartReveal`/`WhyTimeline` built; `whyStats` helper; `npm test`/lint/`build` green. Aurora deferred.
- [ ] **M3 #3 — N-source viz** — surface the 7 new forecasters; still gated on them accruing enough scored days.

## Active (next session): Promotion-readiness audit (dimensions 1–4)
Harden the inherited v1 pipeline before promotion (it publicly grades a named competitor → scrutiny).
**Full handoff: `planning/handoffs/2026-06-24-promotion-readiness-handoff.md`.** Dimensions: (1) data
integrity & silent-failure monitoring, (2) source-labeling honesty, (3) claim defensibility + legal,
(4) scoring robustness. Output = prioritized risk register → this checklist. Known seed issues: no
capture-quality monitoring (the Ray regression went unnoticed for weeks); the live M2 hero still labels the
Open-Meteo fallback as "Apple" (`homeStats.ts`/`Scoreboard.tsx`/`IphoneShot.tsx`); the on-site + `CLAUDE.md`
methodology is stale (no interval/snow model); snow handling unproven on winter data. Run as a multi-agent
Workflow → synthesize → triage → fix; adversarially verify anything touching scoring or public numbers.

## Done: M3 — dynamic data-viz (PR #68 — merged + live)
v1 = Open-Meteo (free) vs Ray's (paid); Apple dropped (its scored data is the Open-Meteo fallback). Built
via subagent-driven TDD + per-task + final adversarial review (READY_TO_MERGE), rebased onto the fair-scoring
`main` (PR #67) and verified live on the corrected data. Spec/plan/handoff:
`planning/specs/2026-06-23-m3-data-viz-design.md`, `planning/plans/2026-06-23-m3-data-viz.md`,
`planning/handoffs/2026-06-23-m3-data-viz-handoff.md`.
- [x] **Interactive trend chart (visx)** — `src/components/TrendChartInteractive.tsx` (`'use client'`):
      Open-Meteo vs Ray's, hover+tap tooltip (predicted/actual/error from the #61 differentials; Ray's
      unpublished precip → "not published"), axes, grade-band lines at 75/60, `@visx/responsive` ParentSize
      in a fixed-height wrapper (no CLS), sr-only data-table equivalent. Static `TrendChart` deleted.
- [x] **Sortable tables + inline sparklines** — `SortableScoreTable.tsx` (`'use client'`): keyboard
      `<button>` headers + `aria-sort`, per-source sparklines over the shared rays-scoped window,
      table→cards below `md`.
- [x] **Coverage matrix** — `CoverageMatrix.tsx` (server): source × field from `scores.json.coverage`;
      Ray's `precip_amount` 0/N as a deliberate "none", partial coverage (wind 76/109) framed as
      availability. `coverage` + corrected `ScoreBreakdownField` added to `src/lib/types.ts`.
- [x] **`@visx/*` deps** — installed (visx v4): responsive scale shape axis grid tooltip group event.
- [x] **Tasteful motion (v1 minimal)** — tooltip/hover transitions only; the ambitious line-draw /
      scrollytelling pass is deferred to a later M3 iteration (no motion lib added).
- [ ] **Widen the source-key type + re-add a real Apple line** (deferred — gated on the expanded N-source
      data + real iPhone-Shortcut Apple data landing) — `src/lib/types.ts` + `SrcKey`/`ORDER`/`LABELS`/
      `IS_FREE`; surface all sources once the data ships.
- [ ] **Relabel the live homepage Apple slot** — the M2 hero scoreboard + "free forecast averaged 91.8"
      still present the Open-Meteo *fallback* as "Apple Weather" (M3 viz correctly omits it). Drop or
      relabel it honestly. (Surfaced by the M3 review; out of M3-viz scope.)

## Post-M2 / parallel follow-ups
- [ ] **Automate the *real* Apple Weather screenshot** — today the hero shot is daily-auto only for the
      Open-Meteo fallback; the real Apple shot needs a manual iPhone-Shortcut upload (`upload_screenshot.yml`).
      Automate the Shortcut + add a reliable source sidecar so `IphoneShot` can drop the
      `REAL_APPLE_MIN_BYTES=500000` heuristic in `src/lib/screenshot.ts`. Owner-owned; out of M3 scope.
- [ ] **OWM/Google snow-depth fix for winter** — OWM/Google snow is a liquid-equiv/depth proxy; the snow-aware
      scoring path is unproven on winter data (season re-scored on mostly summer data). Revisit before M3
      surfaces snow coverage/columns against real winter data.
- [ ] Then: M4 radar/maps + Woolcam + photo-of-the-day, M5 multi-location, M6 Ecowitt station ground-truth.

## To do — site (pre-station, outstanding)
- [ ] **Recalibrate the 5-sweater scale for Boone's climate** — flagged wrong: 54°F scored only
      1/5 sweaters, too low. Boone's elevation/wind/humidity make 54°F feel colder than the
      same temp in a lower town; the scale should reflect local context.
- [ ] Head-to-head accuracy comparison (Ray's vs Dave's Sweater/Open-Meteo) on the homepage,
      like the manual Deep Gap analysis (DS 92/100 vs Ray's 67/100 on 2026-06-14).
      → folded into M2 spec (homepage §4, "Yesterday's head-to-head").
- [x] Logo: Ray's-style white wordmark + white circle behind Dave's face (AI-recolored → `public/assets/logo-white.png`).
- [ ] Copy / sweater-terminology polish.
- [ ] Make scoring methodology visible/defensible on the site (claims = tracked data, not assertion).
- [ ] Update `README.md` — still describes the old GitHub-Pages / `build_site.py` setup; rewrite for Next.js + Vercel.
- [ ] Fourthwall: contact support about the Storefront API 403; if fixed, switch back from the
      Merchant Center RSS feed for richer product data.

## To do — content / distribution
- [ ] Instagram automation (Graph API posting).
- [ ] Weekly summary workflow + graphic.
- [ ] "Woolcam": JideTech 4K 8MP PoE bullet camera (built-in RTMP → YouTube). Not set up.

## To do — weather station hardware
- [ ] Order Wittboy WS90 + GW2000.
- [ ] Order mast/pole mount if not roof-mounting (~$20–50).
- [ ] Site the station: open exposure for wind; shade/airflow for temp; roof preferred.

## To do — weather station software
- [ ] Get Ecowitt application/API key.
- [ ] Write a GitHub Actions job to pull the Ecowitt API and commit the latest reading.
- [ ] Define the data schema / `latest.json` format.
- [ ] Wire observations into the forecast-vs-observed scoring (station becomes the ground-truth
      "actuals" source).

## Open questions
- Is roof/house exposure adequate for wind siting?
- Eventual expansion: distinct named microclimates (Boone / Blowing Rock / Deep Gap) vs. a
  tighter cluster?

## Orange Pi cutover (separate from weather; tracked here because it's in flight)
> Network, VPN, SSH, and host specifics are intentionally **not** stored in this public repo.
> Full details live in a private reference (`orange-pi-handoff.md`, kept local / out of version
> control). The task list below is the only thing tracked here.
- [ ] Move the Pi to the router and connect it over Ethernet.
- [ ] Set a DHCP reservation pinning its address (value in the private reference).
- [ ] **Before cutover:** update the WireGuard `wg0.conf` PostUp/PostDown NAT masquerade rule to
      the new wired interface (otherwise VPN clients lose routing). Details in the private reference.
- [ ] Disable Wi-Fi once stable on wired (one interface, one default route).
- [ ] Confirm WireGuard + SSH still resolve after cutover.
